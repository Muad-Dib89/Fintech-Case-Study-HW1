# IBM Blockchain Case Study 

## Overview and Origin

* IBM: IBM Blockchain Platform

* IBM was founded over 100 years ago in June, 1911. The IBM BLockchain division and platform were founded in 2015. 

* Jerry Cuomo, VP of blockchain technology at IBM was instrumental in founding the platform and blockchain division of IBM. IBM utilizes Hyperledger Fabric, and was a founding member of the Hyperledger consortium. This consortium  worked to develope an open-source Hyperleder Fabric product in tandem with the Linux Foundation.

* The project came about with the idea that there "needed to be a group looking after, governing and shepherding technology around blockchain for serious business and enterprises" - Jerry Cuomo 



## Business Activities:

* IBM Blockchain has many uses and realworld applications of the blockchain are robust. Some examples of financial problems include; supply chain (visibility and tracking, workflow automation), digital identify and credential (personal health, financial and education records with upmost secuirty and privacy), digital assets (tokenization of traditional financial instruments, secure and scalable platforms). 

* IBM Blockchain solutions target businesses big and small across the world. Large customers include CIGNA Coporation, a company worth over $160 billion specializing in healthcare , Anthem Inc specializing in insurance worth over $120 billion and Visa Inc, a banking and financial services organization worth over $20 billion. 

* IBM Blockchain specializes in enterprise solutions for companies big in small. In particular their work on making solutions open source and interporable make their services and solutions available to anyone anywhere. Additonally IBM has the net capital, brand name, and respect in the space of being a large competitor in the Information Technology sector for generations. 

* Nuarca: Voting solution and network, Vertrax: Oil and gas supply chain, Trade Finance: 15 European banks involved traiding of financial instruments, TransparentSupply: Ecosystem for sharing supply chain data to build efficiency and trust, Hyperledger Facbric: framework behind IBM Blockchain and the distributed network. SmartContracts: programs stored on blockchain that run based on predetermiend conditions

## Landscape:

* Monetization Opportuntities: Asset tokenization, Financial Services: Operational simplification, automated compliance, trading, settlement services, forecasting and financial projections, fraud detection, privacy and security. 

* The blockchain industry is growing at an extravegent pace. PoS (proof of stake networks) are cutting don on the envioronment and energy impact of antiquated PoW (Proof of work) solutions. IT is projected that blockchain in the financial sector in the U.S alone will be a $22.5 Billion industry by the year 2026. Regulation in the blockchain industry is starting to mature though there remains alot of ambiguiity. The U.S. government has shown intrest in tokenizing and creating a digital dollar that would continue to jumpstart the industry. Some contries such as China 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
Digital Asset, Accenture, Fujitsu, SWIFT, VMware, Wells Fargo, Ripple, Stellar, Microsoft Azure Blockchain, Oracle Blockchain Cloud Service

## Results

* IBM blockchian is revolutionizing and transforming businesses big and small across the world. 

* Smart Contracts, Distribution, Transaction speed, Adoption (Network addresses) 

* IBM Blockchain has seen outstanding growth and innovation. The trusted network is seeing applications across a wide variety of indsutries. The company continues to innovate and provide leading research in blockchain technologies. Digital transformation is increasing and IBM is a leader in the AI, quantum computing and blockchain space - Arvind Krishna IBM Chairman and CEO. 


## Recommendations

* Continue to innovate and support NFT research projects. 

* NFT (Non Fungible Tokes) are growing in popularity and have use cases across countless industires. By investing in research and the technology now while the industry is very younge IBM can position itself with a frist mover advantage and be a major player in the indsutry.
